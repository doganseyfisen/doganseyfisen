## About me
- I am an automotive engineer, backend and Python developer with a passion for science and technology. I have a master's degree in the history of science. My thesis was on the history of engineering and the internal combustion engine. Previously, I worked as an intern automotive engineer in several companies, where I gained valuable experience in diesel engines, manufacturing, CNC, maintenance, repair, service, and sales. I also developed my coding skills in Python, Django, Flask, API, REST, Java, Git, etc., built many projects with them and obtained several certifications in web development and programming. I am driven by intellectual curiosity, passion and dedication, and thrive in collaborative team environments. I am a firm believer in the power of interdisciplinary collaboration and the benefits it brings. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in these fields and look forward to making a meaningful contribution to the world in these dynamic areas.
