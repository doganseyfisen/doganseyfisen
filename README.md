# About me
- Passionate about coding since my early college years, I quickly realized its allure surpassed my engineering studies. Starting with courses in *Basic Computer Programming and MATLAB* and later exploring languages like *Fortran*, I eventually found my focus in *Java* and *Python*. Constantly seeking new resources and connections to enhance my skills, I am driven to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in technology.
- Dedicated to completing tasks and assuming responsibility for their success, I thrive in collaborative team environments. I strongly believe in the power of interdisciplinary collaborations and the benefits they bring. While my main goal is to excel in development, my ultimate ambition is to become a renowned *Python/Java* expert, making a lasting impact in the field.
